For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to
submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete
structures.

### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

This project would further our use of truth tables by examining natural
deduction and proof theory. We would create a tool that made constructively
valid decisions based on a series of user inputted values to a truth table. The
tool could be customized to make any number of decisions, but we will be
creating one that will determine what job a student should apply for upon
graduation.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea is computer science related because we will be using a program to help
individuals make important life decisions. It will be an algorithm help make
recommendations to students who feel lost about their next step. It will provide
a helpful resource, but will require CS to come in with the logic behind the
recommendations.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no
older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

A general method is created for deriving natural deduction rules from truth
tables and applies to both constructive and classical logic.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This will help with our project because we can use it in order to design
advanced truth tables that will produce sound conclusions.


### Idea 2
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

We will be adapting the traveling salesman problem to find shortest paths
between buildings on campus. The traveling salesmen problem asks: "Given a list
of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest
possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" We will be
using this classic optimization problem to find the shortest possible rout that
visits each academic building in which a particular student has class.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea is expanding upon our section on graph theory. If we imagine each
building on campus as a vertex on a graph G and every path connecting the
buildings as an edge connecting the vertices, G will represent all the ways in
which a student can get to class. We will then assign weights to each edge,
depending on how long each path takes to walk. Using our algorithm, we can then
produce an optimized rout for students to take to class.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

Time Windows are used to advance the traveling salesman problem in order to take
into account time restrictions. The “minimum-cost path of visiting each of a set
of cities exactly once, where each city must be visited within a specified time
window” is explored.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This will support our proposed project because when students are walking to
class they have limited amount of time to get there in order to be on time i.e.
a time window.


### Idea 3
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

The is an analysis on the Monty Hall Problem. The Monty Hall Problem is the idea
that if you have 3 doors in front of you, 2 have a goat behind them and one has
a car. You will make a choice and one of the doors that contains a goat, not the
one you chose, is revealed. You then have the opportunity to switch. It is a
higher probability that you will choose the car if you decide to switch in the
second phase. We will use a computer algorithm to run this scenario many times
to show that this conjecture is true.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

It is connected to Computer Science because we will use an algorithm to
determine where the car has been placed and if we have gotten the choice
correct. This involves an algorithm to place and conditional logic to determine
if the choice was right.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no
older than five years

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05150.pdf

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The thesis in this article is an explanation of the Monty Hall Program. It
explains the win conditions and fractions that pertain to switching the doors.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article will support the idea by providing a control to ensure that the
results are correct. This is really important as without a firm understanding of
the system will work and the win conditions, the system will be unstable and
fault.

### Idea 4
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

For this group project, we would examine the liar's paradox in detail. The
liar's paradox involves a statement of a liar who states that he is lying. If
the liar is lying, then the statement is true then they are not lying, but if
the statement is true then the liar is lying, then the statement false. This
creates a paradox of true and false. The statement creates contradiction when
using binary truth values. If "this sentence is false" is true, then the
sentence is false, but if the sentence states that it is false, and it is false,
then it must be true, and so on.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

For this idea, we would use a randomization algorithm to create different
statements given by the liar. Then we would use truth tables to see if a liar's
paradox or if the statement has a determined value. For this program, we would
use one evaluation for the first round because the statements true/false value
becomes altered on the second evaluation. Another round would be performed with
a second evaluation. The first statement given would also be randomized as true
or false.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

The article focuses on roles of undecidability, universality, diagonalization,
and self-reference when stuck in the Liar's Paradox.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article supports our idea with its exploration of the Liar's Paradox. It
will show us that when using a first evaluation there is no paradox, but on the
second and third paradox will be created.


### Idea 5
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

We would implement and research different algorithms that are used to compute
big 'o' notation and the worst-case time complexity of algorithms, and compare
the results of each. Some specific examples include merge sort, quick sort,
insertion sort, and potentially more. The goal of this project would be to
figure out how to do computations and other actions as quickly and efficiently
as possible.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea is connected to computer science because it is used to organize data
and analyze how efficient algorithms are in programming. Also, it calculates the
worst-case execution time or space required for each algorithm. This helps us to
conclude how much space and time we need to implement each algorithm,
respectively.

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

This article basically talks about what exactly the Big 'O' Notation is,
introducing what it is and how it works mathematically. The main purpose is to
figure out how to do a computation as quickly as we possibly can.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article will support our idea because it will show us how to apply Big 'O'
Notation to different algorithms using multiple methods, ultimately calculating
how to be as efficient as possible when implementing code in a program.
