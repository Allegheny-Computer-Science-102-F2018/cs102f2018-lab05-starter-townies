### Idea 5: Big 'O' Notation & Worst-Case Time Complexity
1) Explain your idea for a class project.

We would implement and research different algorithms that are used to compute big 'o' notation and the worst-case time complexity of algorithms, and compare the results of each. Some specific examples include merge sort, quick sort, insertion sort, and potentially more. The goal of this project would be to figure out how to do computations and other actions as quickly and efficiently as possible.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

This idea is connected to computer science because it is used to organize data and analyze how efficient algorithms are in programming. Also, it calculates the worst-case execution time or space required for each algorithm. This helps us to conclude how much space and time we need to implement each algorithm, respectively.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94818-8_8

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

This article basically talks about what exactly the Big 'O' Notation is, introducing what it is and how it works mathematically. The main purpose is to figure out how to do a computation as quickly as we possibly can.

5) How will this article support your idea?

This article will support our idea because it will show us how to apply Big 'O' Notation to different algorithms using multiple methods, ultimately calculating how to be as efficient as possible when implementing code in a program.
